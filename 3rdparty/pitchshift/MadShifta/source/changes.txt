MAKE SURE THAT WANTEVENTS() AND ALL CANDOS ARE IN ORDER



While translating the source code for MadShifta from Delphi to C++, I 
also made some changes here and there.  This document lists all of the 
changes that I made so that you know what's different about the Delphi 
version vs. this C++ version.  I might have forgotten about a few things, 
but these are what I remember:



	changes to the effect:

changed the way how root key works so that it works correctly

make macros for scaling some of the parameters' 0.0 to 1.0 parameter 
values to their actual values, making it simpler to correctly get the 
real values

fixed getParameterDisplay() and getParameterLabel() so that the correct 
information is displayed when not using the GUI or when using host 
features that utilize that information (like Logic's automation scheme, 
for example)

extended getInputProperties() and getOutputProperties() to handle the 
shortLabels

extended canDo() to include more of the stuff that MadShifta can do



	changes to the graphical interface:

completely re-written to use Steinberg's VSTGUI library

fewer custom mouse cursors (only when they're useful)

clicking on VS won't turn text off (I thought that was a kind of stupid 
feature and didn't want to implement it)

different "about" splash screen, and you don't have to click on "OK," 
clicking anywhere will exit it

fixed root key display so that it accurately reflects the actual root 
key being used

reversed the drag orientation of the "circle" controls (previously, 
dragging up lowered the value and dragging down increased the value; 
this was very counter-intuitive to me)

did not implement the effect of turning the display text from white to 
blue when its background turned red (didn't seem worth the effort and 
that baby blue on red combination hurt my eyes!)

there is no circular fill effect (filling up with red) for the circle 
controls (it would have been a pain to implement and didn't seem worth it)

when you click on the www.smartelectronix.com or www.tobybear.de, you 
will be transported to the respective web page
